HC-05 programming mode detected. Switch to JDY-31 mode by connecting pin 4 to ground or to pin 5.

Now you have 5 seconds for releasing HC-05 module key, which should be pressed at power up to enter program mode.

Now we try to connect to module, read version and baud and wait for new name to be entered.

HC-05 module selected.

Start with baudrate 38400 for HC-05 - factory default for AT command mode
Setup HC-05 module.
